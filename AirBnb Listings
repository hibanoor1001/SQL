# Airbnb Listings Analysis --

# For this project, I downloaded the AirBnb Dataset from Kaggle
# Then I created a table to insert the data.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


# Creating the tables
CREATE TABLE airbnb_listings (
    listing_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    host_id INT NOT NULL,
    host_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    neighborhood VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    room_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    minimum_nights INT NOT NULL,
    number_of_reviews INT NOT NULL
);


# Inserting data from the CSV file into the table
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/listings.csv'
INTO TABLE airbnb_listings
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;


# Exploring the data using SQL
# 1. Get average price per neighborhood
SELECT neighborhood, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM airbnb_listings
GROUP BY neighborhood
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;

# 2. Find hosts with the most listings
SELECT host_name, COUNT(listing_id) AS total_listings
FROM airbnb_listings
GROUP BY host_name
ORDER BY total_listings DESC;

# 3. Identify the most reviewed listings
SELECT listing_id, host_name, number_of_reviews
FROM airbnb_listings
ORDER BY number_of_reviews DESC
LIMIT 10;

# 4. Find most common room types
SELECT room_type, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM airbnb_listings
GROUP BY room_type
ORDER BY count DESC;
