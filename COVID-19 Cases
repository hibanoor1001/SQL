# COVID-19 Cases --

# For this project, I downloaded the Covid-19 Dataset from Kaggle
# Then I created a table to insert the data.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


# Creating the table
CREATE TABLE covid_cases (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    country VARCHAR(100),
    date DATE,
    confirmed_cases INTEGER,
    deaths INTEGER,
    recovered INTEGER
);


# Inserting data from the CSV file into the table
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/country_wise_latest.csv'
INTO TABLE covid_cases
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;


# Exploring the data using SQL
# 1. Get total cases per country
SELECT country, SUM(confirmed_cases) AS total_cases
FROM covid_cases
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_cases DESC;

# 2. Get the top 10 countries with the highest death rate
SELECT country, SUM(deaths) AS total_deaths
FROM covid_cases
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_deaths DESC
LIMIT 10;

# 3. Find the daily increase in confirmed cases
SELECT country, date, confirmed_cases - LAG(confirmed_cases) OVER (PARTITION BY country ORDER BY date) AS daily_increase
FROM covid_cases;

# 4. Determine the recovery rate per country
SELECT country, (SUM(recovered) / SUM(confirmed_cases)) * 100.0 AS recovery_rate
FROM covid_cases
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY recovery_rate DESC;
