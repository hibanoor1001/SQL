# E-commerce Sales Project --

# For this project, I downloaded the E-commerce Sales Dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data
# Then I created a table to insert the data.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


# Creating the table
CREATE TABLE ecommerce_sales (
    order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    product_category VARCHAR(100),
    order_date DATE,
    quantity INTEGER,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);


# Inserting data from the CSV file into the table
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/sales_data.csv'
INTO TABLE ecommerce_sales
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;


# Exploring the data using SQL
# 1. Find the top-selling products by revenue
SELECT product_category, SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM ecommerce_sales
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

# 2. Get the customers who spent the most
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM ecommerce_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 10;

# 3. Determine the most popular product categories by quantity sold
SELECT product_category, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM ecommerce_sales
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;

# 4. Analyze monthly sales trends
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM ecommerce_sales
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month ASC;
