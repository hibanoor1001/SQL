# IMDb Movies Project --

# For this project, I downloaded the IMDb Movies Dataset from their official website - https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/
# Then I created a table to insert the data.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.


# Creating the table
CREATE TABLE imdb_movies (
    movie_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    genre VARCHAR(100),
    release_year INTEGER,
    rating DECIMAL(3,1),
    votes INTEGER,
    revenue_millions DECIMAL(6,2),
    metascore INTEGER
);


# Inserting data from the CSV file into the table
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/title_basics.csv'
INTO TABLE imdb_movies
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;


# Exploring the data using SQL
# 1. Find the highest-rated movies
SELECT title, rating 
FROM imdb_movies 
ORDER BY rating DESC 
LIMIT 10;

# 2. Find the most popular genres by average rating
SELECT genre, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
FROM imdb_movies
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;

# 3. Find the movies with the highest revenue
SELECT title, revenue_millions 
FROM imdb_movies 
ORDER BY revenue_millions DESC 
LIMIT 10;

# 4. Get the number of movies released per year
SELECT release_year, COUNT(*) AS movie_count
FROM imdb_movies
GROUP BY release_year
ORDER BY release_year DESC;
